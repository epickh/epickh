Hello, I'm epickh.

The name consists of the initials of my first 2 names and the first 4 letters of my surname.

- NASM x86-Assembly    (When I want the program to be small)
- Rust                 (Because people want me to use it)
- Visual Studio Code
- Nano                 (Text Editor)

Technology Interests:
- Baremetal Development & OSDev
- Compilers & Interpreters
- Emulators

- Code Size & Speed Optimization

Non-Technology Interests:
- Rock & Metal (have you heard of "Beast in Black"? They are GREAT)
- Garden Work
- Helping People.

Spoken Languages:
- English (fluent, British accent)

I'm a left-behind developer; I didn't catch the hype train.
I don't use the new, shiny, trendy tech and disagree with that whole buzzword bingo, etc.

If you have work for me, I have two open ears.
